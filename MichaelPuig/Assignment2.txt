I am working with Travis Mandeville and we are researching NGC galaxies
Lick Observatory, August 1st-15th
Searching for 20 different ngc galaxies on simbad
We wrote down a list of 20 different galaxies with their RA, DEC and epoch
We took the list and cut it down to 10 and plugged into jskycalc to see which had the best visibility and
picked 10 objects with airmass under 1.5
We have two objects that do not have the best airmass so they will be back up objects (NGC_34, NGC_35)
We will average about 4 hours of observing per night in this timeframe
By checking the seasonal observability table, the moon will be new in the early parts of the month so it will
be best to get observations early in the month
The moon gets full around the 15th of August which is a problem because these galaxies are not very bright
and can be easily over powered by the moon

A month later:
This timeframe will be better than the original one because our objects will be in the sky longer
In August, our objects would be in the sky with airmass under 1.5 for about 4 hours on average
while in September they will be in the sky for an average of about 6 hours
The moon is still new early and the month so it is still best to get most observations in early



I will tag the Jskycalc screenshots of the airmass graph from August and the seasonal observability
which tells us how many hours of observing we can have with low airmass and what phase the moon is in
